# Overview

By default, Azure VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) management and workload clusters are public facing. They can be configure to be private, which means their API server utilises an Azure internal load balancer (ILB) and is therefore only accessible from within the clusterâ€™s own VNet or peered VNets. I've documented the journey I went through deploying a **private** VMware TKG onto Azure, which includes:

- [Prerequisites](1.0_Prerequisites/README.md)
- [Preparing the Bootstrap virtual machine](2.0_Bootstrap_Virtual_Machine/README.md)
- [Deploying the Management cluster](3.0_Management_Cluster/README.md)
- [Deployng the Workload cluster](4.0_Workload_Cluster/README.md)
- [Troubleshooting](5.0_Troubleshooting)

> [!Important]
[Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v2.4.x is the last version of TKG that supports the creation of TKG management and workload clusters on Azure. The ability to create TKG workload clusters on Azure will be removed in the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v2.5 release.](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.4/tkg-deploy-mc/mgmt-release-notes.html)
